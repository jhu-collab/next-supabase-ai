# Hiring Project: AI-Powered Twitter Bio Generator

You are tasked with building a simple Next.js application that allows authenticated users to generate Twitter bios using AI. The aim of this project is to assess your skills in web development, specifically with the PERN stack, TypeScript, and Next.js.

## Requirements

1. **Next.js**: Initialize a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app ([version 13.4](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-4)) with the new [app router](https://nextjs.org/blog/june-2023-update).
2. **Authentication**: Integrate [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for passwordless authentication using [magic links](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-magic-link). Only authenticated users should access the app. Unauthenticated users should only see the sign-in page.
3. **Functionality**: Once authenticated, users should be able to input a brief biography and get a generated Twitter bio, similar to [this tool](https://threadcreator.com/tools/twitter-bio-generator).
4. **OpenAI Integration**: The app should require users to input their OpenAI API key to utilize the bio generation functionality. Ensure users do not commit their API keys to the repository.
5. **UI**: While the primary focus is on functionality, a well-designed UI could distinguish your application.

## Instructions

1. **Repository Setup**: Clone this starter repository.
2. **Development**: Work on your code in a `dev` branch.
3. **Deployment**: Deploy your finished app on Vercel.
4. **Submission**: Create a PR from your `dev` branch to the `main` branch and add me @madooei as a reviewer.

## Additional Notes

- **Timeline**: The hiring process will be conducted on a "first come, first serve" basis. The sooner you complete and submit your project, the higher your chances.
- **Independence**: While we typically offer support to our students, for this specific task, the objective is to evaluate your ability to work independently and under minimal supervision. As such, we will not be assisting with any issues or challenges you encounter while building this app.
- **Feedback**: Due to the volume of applications, feedback might be limited. However, we appreciate your effort and time.
